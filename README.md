## üõ†Ô∏è Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhuragrawal/email-automation.git
cd email-automation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies  

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables  

Create a `.env` file in the project‚Äôs root directory with the following keys:  

```plaintext
# SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=your_email@example.com

```

### 4. Customize Email Templates

## üì§ Usage  

### 1. Add Recipient Data  

In the `setup.js` file, define the data as follows:  

```javascript
// Common variables for email templates
// These variables will be used in the templates when no recipient-specific data is provided.
export const emailVariables = {
    senderName: SENDER_NAME,
    resumeLink: 'https://your-resume-link.com',
    portfolioLink: 'https://your-portfolio-link.com',
    role: "Software Engineer", // Default role if not specified in recipient-specific data
    companyName: "Company A", // Default company name if not specified in recipient-specific data
};

// Example usage
// The mails array contains:
// - The first element is the email address (or a comma-separated list of email addresses).
// - The second element is an optional placeholders object for recipient-specific data.
// Recipient-specific data takes precedence over common variables in `emailVariables`.
export const mails = [
    ["recipient1@example.com", { role: "Frontend Developer", companyName: "Company B" }],
    ["recipient2@example.com, recipient3@example.com"], // Uses defaults from `emailVariables` if no placeholders provided
];

```

### 2. Run the Application  

Use the following command to start sending emails:  

```bash
node index.js
```

or


```bash
npm run send
```

### 3. Output:
- Real-time progress bar showing how many emails have been sent.
- Summary of total accepted and rejected emails.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security  

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like SMTP credentials is stored securely in the `.env` file. Ensure this file is never committed to version control.  
- **Encryption**: Use strong passwords and, if possible, application-specific passwords for email accounts.
